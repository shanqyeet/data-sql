Foreign-key: a foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table or the same table.

1. SQLite 
2. MySQL 
3. PostgresQL 

To understand the differences, check [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/sqlite-vs-mysql-vs-postgresql-a-comparison-of-relational-database-management-systems) out. 

*there is also a NoSQL.. but #DYOR*
