### Important Components of a Database

Primary-key: a key and a unique identifier in a relational database that makes each record unique!

> It's like your genetic profile, it marks your unique identity and your existence

Foreign-key: a foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table or the same table.

> It's like a wedding ring, you are a unique existence but that ring on your finger tells people that you belong to someone else.
